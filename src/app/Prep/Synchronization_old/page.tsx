                  If your score is low, it means your brain's peak performance doesn't match your current school schedule. That
                  might sound bad â€” but here's the upside: you've been working at a disadvantage, and now we know! That means
                  any improvements in alignment (like timing homework better, improving sleep, or adjusting focus windows) could
                  give you a big boost in performance. It's like taking off a backpack full of bricks you didn't know you were carrying.
